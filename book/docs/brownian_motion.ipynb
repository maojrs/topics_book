We can observe similar movements on dust particles floating on air. To introduce Brownian motion, we show below a video of nanoparticles (small particles) in water, as we can see, they jiggle randomly. This random jiggling is what we call Brownian motion, and we thus call these particles Brownian particles."

    "## 5. Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "- We derived the Einstein relation that establishes a relation between diffusion and dissipation in Brownian particles. This is a fundamental result to connect the microscopic world described by the dynamics of particles with the macroscopic emergent phenomena such as diffusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We introduced the dynamics of individual Brownian particles through a simulation scheme, and we showed how it can be extended to two (or more) dimensions. We hint at the connection to the field of stochastic differential equations, which is the mathematically correct approach to understand Brownian motion. This theory correspond to the microscopic theory (bottom).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We showed that the diffusion equation emerges from the dynamics of a large number of Brownian particles. This corresponds to the macroscopic theory (top). Although we used Fick's law (an emergent law) to derive the equation. It can be done without it, but it requires more advanced techniques. This is left as a possible project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To really show the macroscopic diffusion emerges from the dynamics of a large number of individual Brownian particles, we implemented numerical validation, and we compared the results with the solution to the corresponding diffusion equation. We finally show the final form of the stochastic differential equation for Brownian motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The studies of Brownian motion not only provided a physical theory to describe Brownian movement; they also gave birth to the field of stochastic differential equations. These equations describe trajectories that are nowhere differentiable, such as idealized Brownian trajectories, and thus require a different type of calculus called Ito calculus. Furthermore, each system of stochastic differential equations has a corresponding emergent \"diffusion\" equation called the Fokker-Planck equation. This yields a fundamental duality; the stochastic dynamics of individual particles/agents together with the probabilistc dynamics of an ensemble of identical particles/agents are two sides of the same underlying process, an stochastic process. Today, these equations are used in applications ranging from molecular biology to financial mathematics. "

    "## Historical background overview\n",
    "(based on {cite}`nelson2020dynamical` Dynamical theories of Brownian motion by Edward Nelson)\n",
    "- In the early 1800's, the botanist Robert Brown studied the apparently random movement of pollen particles suspended in water, now called Brownian motion. Since practically anyone looking at water through a microscope was able to see little things moving around, he did not discover Brownian motion. However, he did establish Brownian motion as an important phenomenon, and he ruled out the hypothesis that the effect was life-related.\n",
    "- The phenomenon continued to be studied by several scientists. By 1905, the kinetic theory, that Brownian motion of microscopic particles is caused by bombardment by the molecules of the fluid, seemed the most plausible. However, the attempts failed due to the fractal nature of the velocity of Brownian particles.\n",
    "- In 1905, Einstein's publishes in one of his Annus Mirabilis papers, where he developed the statistical mechanics and the molecular-kinetic theory of thermodynamics. He did this mostly unaware of the existence of the phenomenon and previous studies. The theory was correct and described consistently the experimental observations of Brownian motion.\n",
    "- Despite having developed a succesful theory, Einstein's theory does not give a dynamical theory of Brownian motion; it only determines the nature of the motion and the value of the diffusion coefficient on the basis of some assumptions. Smoluchowski and Langevin, independently from Einstein, attempted a dynamical theory, and arrived to similar results. These dynamic theory of Brownian motion was the birth of the field of stochastic differential equations.\n",
    "- The agreement of these considerations with experience together with Planck’s determination of the true molecular size from the law of radiation (for high temperatures) convinced the sceptics, who were quite numerous at that time (Ostwald, Mach) of the reality of atoms."
