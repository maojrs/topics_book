Since practically anyone with a microscope could observe this phenomena, he is not credited with its discovery.

For his work on the topic, this random movement and yiggling of particles is now called Brownian motion.\n",

    "We can observe similar phenomena in the movements on dust particles floating on air. The phenomenon continued to be studied by several scientists. By 1905, the kinetic theory seemed the most plausible explanation for Brownian motion. This theory states that fluids, like gas and water, are composed of a large number of identical tiny particles in constant and rapid motion that are constantly colliding with each other. Then, the Brownian motion of a pollen grain or a dust particle in a fluid could be explained by the movement resulting from the constant collision against the fluid particles. Although this was conceptually correct, theoretical attempts to describe experimental observations kept failing.\n",

    "Although the movement of Brownian particles is random, we can ask ourselves if there is anything predictable about their movement? If there is some predictable behavior, maybe there is also predictable behavior in other random systems, such as the economy, social networks and molecular biology. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we would like to describe the movement of Brownian particles with a mathematical model. As the formal theory of Brownian motion is quite involved, a more accesible approach is to use computational simulations. One reason Einstein's approach succesfully describe Brownian motion is because it focuses on the positions of particles while ignoring their velocities. Mimicking his spirit, consider a Brownian particle with its position $x(t)$ given by a function of time $t$. We assume the particle only moves in one dimension, so it can only move left and right. Given the position at time $t=0$, we would like to calculate its position at a later time, say $t=1$ later. As Brownian motion is random, we expect to add a random number $R$,\n",

If you observe Brownian particles, they are likely to stay in the same area, small movements seem much more likely than large ones. Furthermore, it seems every direction is equally likely, so a natural candidate is a normal distribution with mean zero. If you don't know what is a normal distribution, check the [random numbers chapter](./basic_concepts/random_numbers). How likely it is to go farther away, can be modulated by the constant $\\sigma$. We thus write the equation for the time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle as\n",

    "\n",
    "- We introduced the dynamics of individual Brownian particles through a simulation scheme, and we showed how it can be extended to two (or more) dimensions. We hint at the connection to the field of stochastic differential equations, which is the mathematically correct approach to model Brownian motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using computational simulations of Brownian motion, we showed that the collective behavior of a large number of Brownian particles obeys the diffusion equation. The diffusion equation has no random components, and thus it is deterministic. In other words, despite Brownian motion being random, its collective behavior is predictable. The emergence of the diffusion equation from the dynamics of a large number of Brownian particles can actually be proved mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Einstein's work, the scientific community was divided about the existence of atoms. Thanks to Einstein's theory of Brownian motion along with other physical advances at the time convinced the sceptics, who were quite numerous at that time (Ostwald, Mach), of the reality of atoms {cite}`nelson2020dynamical`. Let me rephrase this, around 100 and some years ago, we were not even sure of the existence of atoms. In a 100 years from now, what other scientific facts will be trivial that are still unknown today. \n",
    "\n",
    "The studies of Brownian motion not only provided a physical theory to describe Brownian movement; they also gave birth to the field of stochastic differential equations. These equations describe trajectories that are nowhere differentiable, such as idealized Brownian trajectories, and thus require a different type of calculus  called stochastic calculus. Furthermore, each system of stochastic differential equations has a corresponding emergent \"diffusion\" equation called the Fokker-Planck equation. This yields a fundamental duality of the same underlying process: the stochastic dynamics of individual particles/agents together with the probabilistc dynamics of an ensemble of identical particles/agents. Today, these equations are used in applications ranging from molecular biology to financial mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should note this was just a brief and incomplete introduction to Brownian motion. There are many other important personalities, such as Smoluchowski and Langevin, involved in the development of Brownian motion. There are also many results and important theoretical details ommited. If the reader is interested in learning more about the topic, we recommend checking the references below."
